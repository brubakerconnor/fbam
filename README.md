## Frequency Band Analysis for Multiple Stationary Time Series (FBAM)

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.13397030.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13397030)

This package implements the FBAM method for the
simultaneous subpopulation and frequency band estimation of 
multiple stationary time series.

The package can be installed using 

```
devtools::install_github("brubakerconnor/fbam")
```

Supplementary code needed to reproduce the simulation studies and data analysis 
included in the article can be found [here](https://github.com/brubakerconnor/fbam-extra).
