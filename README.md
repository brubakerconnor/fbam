These scripts implement the FBAM method, simulation studies, and application found in the associated article. The files included in this repository are
1. `fbam_Rfunctions.R`: implements the genetic algorithm and grid search routine. Also includes simulation model definitions and sine multitaper estimator function.
3. `fbam_simExample.R`: used for replicating our simulation studies.
4. `fbam_gaitAnalysis.R`: analysis of gait variability data.
